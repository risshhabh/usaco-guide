USACO Guide
***

These are a collection of problems I solved to practice and improve my competitive programming skills. Following [USACO Guide's](https://usaco.guide) curriculum.

I implemented the vast majority of problems in Python. The problems are mainly sourced from the following (original links provided in code):
- [USA Computing Olympiad (USACO)](https://usaco.org/)
- [Code Submission Evaluation System (CSES)](https://cses.fi/)
- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)
Problems are split into subdirectories following USACO Guide's section formatting.

Additionally, I included Jupyter notebooks / other notes I took in the `learn/` directory. The original lectures / textbooks are included as links in the markdown sections.
